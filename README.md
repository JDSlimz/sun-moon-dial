# sun-moon-dial
Made this back in Jan 2016. Wanted to make it public.

This project uses <a href="https://github.com/mourner/suncalc">Mourner's Suncalc</a>, <a href="http://jqueryrotate.com/">jQuery Rotate</a>, and <a href="https://momentjs.com/">MomentJS</a>.

These plugins combined create a clock that shows you the angle of the sun and moon relative to your horizon.
It also uses <a href="https://www.wunderground.com">Weather Underground's</a> API to give you up to date weather at your location.

Location must be enabled for this site to work at all.

<a href="https://jdslimz.github.io/sun-moon-dial/">See it in action!</a>

Disclaimer: It has been noted that occasionally if you leave the site up in the background, some of the calcuations get weird and positions are wrong, a simple refresh fixes that for now. Looking into a fix.
